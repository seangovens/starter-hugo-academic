I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Waterloo. My research focus is the theory of distributed computing. I am particularly interested in proving lower bounds on the time and space complexities of distributed algorithms. I also enjoy studying concurrent data structures, randomized algorithms, and performance profilers and visualizations for multithreaded applications.
