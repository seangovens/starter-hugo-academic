 abstract = {Nearly thirty years ago, it was shown that Ω(√n ) read/write registers are needed to solve obstruction-free consensus among n processes. This lower bound was improved to n registers in 2018, which exactly matches the best upper bound. The Ømega (√n) space complexity lower bound actually applies to a class of objects called historyless objects, which includes read/write registers, test-and-set objects, and readable swap objects. However, every known n-process obstruction-free consensus algorithm from historyless objects uses Ω(n) objects.In this paper, we give the first Ω(n) space complexity lower bounds for two kinds of historyless objects. First, we show that any obstruction-free consensus algorithm from swap objects uses at least n-1 objects. We also present an obstruction-free consensus algorithm from n-1 swap objects, exactly matching our lower bound. To our knowledge, this is the first consensus algorithm from swap objects that do not also support the Read operation.Second, we show that any obstruction-free binary consensus algorithm from readable binary swap objects uses at least n - 2 objects. The best known obstruction-free binary consensus algorithm from readable binary swap objects uses 2n-1 objects, which shows that our lower bound is asymptotically tight. Since any historyless object can be simulated by a readable swap object with the same domain, our results imply that any obstruction-free consensus algorithm from binary historyless objects uses at least n - 2 objects.},
